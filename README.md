# Empirical Methods Comparison

This repository contains selected R scripts from an empirical research project
comparing Fama–MacBeth two-step regressions and panel fixed-effects models.

The code focuses on:
- Data construction and variable alignment
- Estimation of risk premia
- Comparison of inference under different error structures

Data files are not included due to access restrictions.
Replication code is available upon request.
